  &lt;p&gt;“The tour was amazing and I am so glad I was able to go. One thing I really appreciated was how the tour guides made a detour and showed us the IT department since most of us were Computer Science majors. Also learning about the simulators and the history behind them was pretty thoughtful as well. If given the opportunity I would definitely go again.” – Wendy Rodriguez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Boeing Tour was a great experience! Personally, they were very informative what is the company purpose, and the opportunities that are met. During the tour, I found out that they create different model for planes. The staff members were friendly. Then, they took us to see the computer room to see the simulator, and it shows the map of different places. After that, it was awesome and interesting how they teach students how to fix parts of the plane. In general, I would give it a 10/10.” –Natasha Campos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“They teach their client’s (airlines) pilots in a structured and organized way. It is almost nerve wreaking how well planed is everything set in there. Adding to that how realistic simulators they have there. I would most definitely want to go again.”– Patricia Gonzalez&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being into airplanes is amazing: isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professional and student chapters throughout the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mission&quot;&gt;Mission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHPE&lt;/strong&gt; changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vision&quot;&gt;Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHPE’s vision is a world where Hispanics are highly valued and influential as the leading innovators, scientists, mathematicians and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regions&quot;&gt;Regions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHPE is a national organization and is divided into seven regions as the picture below shows.&lt;/p&gt;
