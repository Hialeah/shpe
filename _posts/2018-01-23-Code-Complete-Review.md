Code complete is a book on Software Engineering, written by Steve McConnell and published in 1993. Kind of old, you may say, Yes, but the ideas on this book are amazing and will change the way you see software construction by making you understand that the word "engineering" does make sense when we refer to the field.

1. Coding VS Software Construction : 
---
  Although coding and software engineering is often used interchancbly these two are not quite the same. “Software Construction” Refers to "coding" and debugging, but also includes design, unit testing, integration testing and other activities. When we say “coding” we often refer to the mechanical action of translating a pre-existing design to a computer language. 
  
 2. Documentation.
 ---
 
  You may have had a programming professor who takes away points from your assignment if it is not documented correclty. You don't really like that right? Think about it, the product of construction, the source code, is often the only documentation that is available to the programmers, thus it is imperative that the source code has the highest quality possible. When you write code, think about your audience, your fellow programmers who one day may have to maintain that code.
  
 3. Methaphors.
 ---
  The most challenging part of programming is conceptualizing the problem. Metaphors often provide helpful insides to seeing the problem from different angles. It is impossible to create a set of instructions that solve every problem, thus the ability to approach problems is more valuable than knowing specific solutions.
 
 4. Quality Assurance is not jut Testing.
 ---
  Measure twice cut one !
  Software quality assurance is not limited to testing. Testing cannot reveal problems that were introduced in the prerequisites development or problem definition stage. You may have a fully functional program that solves the wrong problem due to incorrect problem definition, you may have the program that solves the right problem but does not include all desired functionalities due to incorrect prerequisites developments, finally, you may be solving the right problem with the right features but just the wrong way due to poor architectural design. Explicit requirements prevent you from guessing what the user wants. 
Tip : Have a problem definition, a clear statement of the problem the system is supposed to solve.
Objection: Keep in mind that stable requirements is often a myth, customers will change their requirements as the system progresses, as they will understand their own need as the project advances.

 5. Programming Languages :
 ---
  Your programming tools don’t have to determine how you think about programming. Program into the language, not in the language should be your . 
  Programming “in” a language : A programmer that programs “in” a language limits thoughts to the contructs provided by the language. Thus, if the language is primitive, their thought will also be primitive. 
Programming “into” a language : A programmer that programs “into” a language will first decide what thoughts he/she wants to express, then determine how to express this thoughts using the tools provided by the language.

There is much more to learn from this book. I highly recommend it. Thanks for reading.
