Previously established in Fall of 2015 by Raul de la Rosa, in Miami Dade College (MDC), Hialeah Campus.
The 2018 MDC SHPE Chapter is dedicated to letting our members explore and increase their professional opportunities through tours to local companies.

 Boeing was the first company who opened their doors to us.
 The tour of their facilities has successfully motivated our students to continue their studies
 and focus on their careers so one day they are able to work in a place they were just “touring” at one point.
 The Sony internship our campus provides and cultivates the necessary skills to survive in the corporate
 world where effectiveness, efficiency, and innovation are well appreciated.


 We also notify our members about upcoming scholarships, internships, and fellowships offered by STEM
 affiliated companies and organizations. In the NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS), our
 members are introduced to collaborate with students from diverse backgrounds and cultures and give
 them the experience needed in their STEM discipline.

 Overall, our goal is to train and mold our students into the engineers and scientists of tomorrow
 by introducing them to the wonders of their careers in every way we can.

### Chapter Mission

### Our Vision:

by organizing community service projects related to STEM, creating partnerships with
companies to hold workshops and career fairs at Miami Dade College and hosting social
events to bring the STEM community to Miami Dade College. Our chapter will strive to make
success the only option our members choose to take by making it easily accessible through SHPE.
